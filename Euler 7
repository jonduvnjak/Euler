#Can only be divided by itself and 1
#How do you then check whether a number is prime?
#Do you divide it by all numbers less than a half of it?
#I'll need a counter to count how many primes there are
#I'll need to print the 10,001st prime and break
#I'll need to loop until the counter hits 10,001
#I need some way to contain each check of a prime and reset when the check is complete. Righ now as soon as it cannot divide evenly with a single number in the range then it is printing that number
#Each check can stop as soon as it finds a number it can evenly devide by. Once it checks all numbers to 1/2 the prime, if all 
# give uneven di isions then it is a prime.
